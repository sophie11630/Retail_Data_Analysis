Sales forecasting is one important aspect for the management of retail stores. By pulling data from Kaggle, we have obtained three historical sales data, which covers 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. Given multiple numerical and categorical features, our analysis will be selecting a best model for predicting the weekly sales of retail stores. The goal of this project is to predict the weekly sales as accurately as possible, and we will be choosing RMSE as our key performance metric, and finally, choose the best prediction model. By looking at our trained models, we could get a better sense of what features are of more importance in determining the sales performance of a retail store, and we could use those results to make suggestions on what good action or strategies retail stores could use to increase sales.
